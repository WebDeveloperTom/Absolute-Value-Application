## About <a name = "about"></a>

These small projects were created for the application to the [Part - Full time Junior Fullstack Developer](https://www.seek.co.nz/job/39368597).

- Project 1

```
"A simple responsive registration form – without any logic, just HTML + CSS, you can use any design framework. The goal is that the registration form labels and inputs must be in single line."
```

The form found in index.html was quickly whipped up using the Bootstrap4 framework. I used the Bootstrap4 framework as it is simple and easy to generate a functional project right out of the gates. The task required "a simple responsive registration form" and Bootstrap4 gives this while only using a few classes.

I could have also achieved the same result using CSS FlexBox.

```
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
```

- Project 2

```
"A simple Javascript file with a function of 1 parameter: x, and the result of the function is the Fibonacci sequence string till that number. Please use clean code and commas to separate the numbers. For example if x=6 than the result should be “1,1,2,3,5”."
```

The Javascript found in fibonacci.js contains a simple function, fib, that takes in a value, x and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to and _including_ that number.
